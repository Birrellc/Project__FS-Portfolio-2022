# Chris Birrell Full Stack Portfolio 2022


---

## Description

_My Current portfolio_
This is a Full Stack Portfolio website with **ReactJS** for the frontend along with **SCSS** for styling and **Sanity** used for the backend.

The main purpose of this project is to have a website where I can show off some of my work and skills to gain employement as a junior developer in this industry.

I decided to go with a more artistic themed portfolio instead of the traditional style with a color theme of a more cyberpunk combined with paint splashes and animation.
